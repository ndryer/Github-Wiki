# Code Standards

## Introduction

Code standards are a set of guidelines and best practices for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. Adhering to these standards helps ensure consistency across the codebase, making it easier for team members to collaborate and maintain the code.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Meaningful Variable and Function Names

- Choose descriptive names that clearly convey the purpose of the variable or function.
- Avoid using single-letter names, except for loop counters.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `myVariable`, `calculateTotal`).

### 2. Write Modular and Reusable Code

- Break down large functions into smaller, reusable functions.
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - each function should have a single responsibility.
- Use modules or classes to organize related functions and data.

### 3. Comment Your Code

- Write clear and concise comments to explain the purpose of complex code.
- Use comments to document the expected input and output of functions.
- Avoid redundant comments that state the obvious.

### 4. Follow Consistent Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 or 4 spaces) throughout the codebase.
- Follow a consistent style for braces, parentheses, and other punctuation.
- Use a linter to enforce formatting rules and catch common errors.

### 5. Write Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for all functions and modules to ensure they work as expected.
- Use a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha) to organize and run tests.
- Aim for high test coverage to catch potential issues early.

### 6. Handle Errors Gracefully

- Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and errors.
- Provide meaningful error messages to help diagnose issues.
- Avoid using generic error messages like "An error occurred."

### 7. Optimize for Performance

- Write efficient code that minimizes resource usage (e.g., CPU, memory).
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms for the task at hand.
- Profile and optimize performance-critical sections of the code.

## Examples

### Example 1: Meaningful Variable Names

```javascript
// Bad
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = x + y;

// Good
let width = 10;
let height = 20;
let area = width + height;
```

### Example 2: Modular Code

```javascript
// Bad
function processOrder(order) {
  // Validate order
  if (!order.id || !order.items) {
    throw new Error("Invalid order");
  }

  // Calculate total
  let total = 0;
  for (let item of order.items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }

  // Process payment
  if (!processPayment(order.paymentInfo, total)) {
    throw new Error("Payment failed");
  }

  // Send confirmation
  sendConfirmation(order.id);
}

// Good
function validateOrder(order) {
  if (!order.id || !order.items) {
    throw new Error("Invalid order");
  }
}

function calculateTotal(items) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

function processOrder(order) {
  validateOrder(order);
  let total = calculateTotal(order.items);
  if (!processPayment(order.paymentInfo, total)) {
    throw new Error("Payment failed");
  }
  sendConfirmation(order.id);
}
```

## Conclusion

Following these code standards and best practices will help ensure that your code is clean, maintainable, and efficient. Consistency in coding style and practices makes it easier for team members to collaborate and maintain the codebase, ultimately leading to better software quality.
